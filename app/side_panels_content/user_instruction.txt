User Instructions for the Polish Sign Language Translation App
Launch the App: Open the Polish Sign Language Translation App on your device.

Enable Camera Access: Upon opening, the app will prompt you to grant camera access. Click "Allow" to enable live video input, essential for recognizing and translating gestures.

Position Your Hands: Stand or sit in front of the camera, positioning your hands within the frame so the app can clearly capture your gestures. Ensure there’s adequate lighting for optimal recognition.

Adjust if Needed: If translation accuracy seems off, try repositioning your hands within the frame or adjusting lighting conditions.
