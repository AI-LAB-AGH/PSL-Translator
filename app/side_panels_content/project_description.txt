The Polish Sign Language Translation App is an innovative tool designed to provide real-time translation of Polish Sign Language (PJM) gestures into written text using a camera. This application leverages a machine learning model to recognize specific gestures captured in live video, facilitating seamless communication between sign language users and non-sign language speakers. The app processes video frames from a camera feed, identifies hand landmarks, and classifies gestures, displaying the translation on the screen instantly. Built with accessibility and user-friendliness in mind, it aims to bridge the gap in communication by making PJM translations readily available in real-time for diverse contexts and users.
